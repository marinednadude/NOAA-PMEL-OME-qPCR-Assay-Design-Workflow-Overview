Welcome to NOAA PMEL OME qPCR Asaay Design Workflow Overview
===================================

This is a product of the [NOAA PMEL Ocean Molecular Ecology Lab](https://github.com/NOAA-PMEL/Ocean-Molecular-Ecology).
Here we present an overview for how to design a new probe based qPCR assay for eDNA. This is applicable to other assay design (e.g. ddPCR).

Documentation is hosted on Read the Docs.
